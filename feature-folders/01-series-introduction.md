# Series : Mindset architecture evolution

## Introducing the "Mindset architecture evolution" series

In this series of articles, we'll go over the evolution of one of our mobile apps, Mindset,
Our journey through the evolution of the architecture of one of our mobile apps : Mindset.

As we developed the app, its codebase grew, and we had to look for ways for it to not get out of hands, still enabling our team to deliver new features, welcome new team members and not break any existing parts. In the next articles we'll talk about how we did this.

In this series, we'll be talking about Mindset, one of the app we are working on at Koa Health. In order to help understand a bit more the technical concerns, you probably need a bit of context about what that app is about.
